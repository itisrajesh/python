    "## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models real-world entities as objects, each with its own data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "It emphasizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code organization\n",
    "- Reusability\n",
    "- Maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blueprints:** Think of classes as blueprints or templates that define the structure and behavior of objects. They specify the attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes:** These are the characteristics or properties that objects of a class will possess. They hold data associated with the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods:** These are the actions or operations that objects of a class can perform. They define the behavior and functionality of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instances:** Objects are instances of a class. They are created from the blueprint defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes:** Each object has its own set of attributes, which can hold different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods:** Objects can call their methods to perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pillars of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods within an object to protect data integrity and control access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes based on existing classes to reuse code and establish relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:** Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same type, enabling flexibility and code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction:** Focusing on the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in object-oriented programming is the ability of objects of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type. This allows for code to be written in a more flexible and reusable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Method Overriding (Single Inheritance):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "dog.speak()  # Output: Woof! I'm Buddy the dog.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The `speak` method is overridden in the `Dog` class, providing a specific implementation for dogs. When calling `speak` on a `Dog` object, the overridden version is executed.\n",

    "#### 2. Method Overloading (Not directly supported in Python):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",

    "result2 = calculator.add(2, 3, 4)  # Output: 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** While Python doesn't support true method overloading, you can achieve similar behavior by using variable arguments (`*args`) or keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
